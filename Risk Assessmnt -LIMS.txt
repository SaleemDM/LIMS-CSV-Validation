✅ SECTION 2: PURPOSE
This protocol defines the process to identify, assess, and mitigate risks related to LIMS usage in a GxP-regulated environment. It ensures that validation is focused on functions impacting product quality, data integrity, and patient safety.


________________


✅ SECTION 3: METHODOLOGY
Risk Priority Number (RPN) = Severity × Occurrence × Detectability
 Each rated 1–5 (High = 5).
Post-mitigation, risk is reassessed.

High-risk areas (RPN > 50):
* Require end-to-end testing in IQ/OQ/PQ

* Will be traced directly in Traceability Matrix

* May need additional user training and monitoring

Medium-risk areas (RPN 21–50):
   * Require full functional testing

   * Focused PQ and SOP coverage

Low-risk areas (RPN ≤ 20):
      * Document and test where feasible

      * Leverage vendor validation documentation

	✅ SECTION 7: TRACEABILITY TO TESTING
         * R1, R2, R4, R5 → PQ Testing required

         * R3, R6, R7 → OQ Testing

         * R8 → IQ check + SOP testing

✅ SECTION 8: CONCLUSION
All critical functions have been assessed, mitigated, and assigned to test protocols accordingly.
Post-mitigation risks are acceptable.
 Validation activities will ensure compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11, EU GMP Annex 11, and data integrity standards (ALCOA+).
