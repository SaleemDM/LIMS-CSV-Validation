✅ 6. Key Test Results
   * ✅ Audit trail records edits, deletions, and e-signatures

   * ✅ Electronic signatures enforce reason + password (Part 11)

   * ✅ Result entry is validated against upper/lower thresholds

   * ✅ Barcode sample registration and lifecycle workflow verified

   * ✅ Instrument file import tested (CSV + error handling)

   * ✅ Certificates of Analysis (CoA) generated and version-controlled

✅ 7. Risk-Based Coverage
All high and medium-risk URS items from the Risk Assessment were fully tested in IQ, OQ, or PQ:
      * Audit trail

      * Signature controls

      * Result validation

      * User access management

      * Data backup and retention

________________


✅ 8. Conclusion
The LIMS system has passed all validation tests and is proven to meet:
         * Functional requirements (URS)

         * Regulatory compliance (21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11)

         * Data integrity principles (ALCOA+)

         * GxP expectations per FDA, EMA, and WHO standards

No outstanding deviations remain. The system is now qualified for GxP use and ready for go-live.
