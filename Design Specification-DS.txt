✅ 2. Purpose
To define the technical and configuration design of the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) that implements the functions described in the Functional Specification. This includes screen layouts, field logic, workflow rules, system integration, and security settings.
________________


✅ 3. Scope
Covers design for the following components:
* Sample management

* Test entry and validation

* Instrument interface

* User access control

* Audit trail configuration

* Electronic signatures

* Report templates

* Data storage and backup logic

________________


✅ 4. System Architecture
   * Architecture Type: 3-tier (Web UI – Application Server – DB Server)

   * Database: Oracle 19c

   * Web Interface: HTML5 with REST API

   * Middleware: [Instrument Integration Tool, e.g. LabWare Interface Engine]
